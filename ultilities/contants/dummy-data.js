          <ul class="">
             <li>Our client files are stored on our secure client management systems. Access is restricted on our client systems to those within the business who are required to have access to your information for legitimate business purposes; and</li>
             <li>Hard copy documentation is stored in locked cabinets.</li>
             <li>We ensure access to your Personal Data is restricted to Savills employees and workers or other persons working within the Savills Group on a need to know basis. Training is provided to any of those Savills employees and workers who need access to personal data.</li>

          <p class="">However, we cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to us and you do so entirely at your own risk.

       </li>

       <li class=" ">
          <h4 class="">For how long do we keep your Personal Data</h4>
          <p class="">The period for which we will keep your Personal Data will depend on the type of service you have requested from us. The retention period may be longer than the period for which we are providing services to you where we have statutory or regulatory obligations to retain Personal Data for a longer period, or where we may need to retain the information in case of a legal claim.</p>
